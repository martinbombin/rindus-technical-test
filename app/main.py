"""FastAPI application setup and startup configuration.

This module initializes the FastAPI app, configures the database connection,
creates database tables at startup, and includes API routers.

Key components:
- `lifespan`: Async context manager that sets up the database engine on app startup.
- `create_db_and_tables`: Initializes database schema from ORM models.
- `app`: The FastAPI instance with registered routes and lifecycle management.
